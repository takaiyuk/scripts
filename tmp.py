Your rank on Public LB may be {num_team_onshot_zero} place higher than it is, if you are not lazy.

From public leader board, we can get the number of the teams who submit only one submission, whose score is zero.
The number is {num_team_onshot_zero} at the time I post this.
This means that {num_team_onshot_zero} teams will disappear or shake down due to their wrong submission when Private LB is calculated.
So you are now ranked {num_team_onshot_zero} place higher than it is, if you are not in those teams.
Is this idea wrong?
